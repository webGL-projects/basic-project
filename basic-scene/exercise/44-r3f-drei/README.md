# Drei 
scenes are going to get even simplier

Because react has the ability to make things reusable, R3F took advantage of that and developers created many components called helpers

 some examples are:
 1. Camera Controls
 2. Complex Geometries
 3. Post-Processing
 4. HTML Implementation
 5. Loaders
 6. Environment Settings
 7. Complex Calculations

some of them will be implemented as components <theHelper> and some as hooks (useHelper) most of them are regrouped in drei (Three in German)

drei are helpers used to mkae life easier 

drei is part of the @react-three scope

OrbitControls is set with enabledDamping which make the animation smoother and we don't have to ask it to update itself on each frame
