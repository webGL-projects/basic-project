# React 
Threejs used perviously is pure js now its time to use React

its a library used to create UI, using JSX (tag-based language very similer to HTML) and it gets compiled to a traditional website 

when data changes, the UI will change automatically the UI will 'react' to the data (data-binding)

it can build more that websites

Drawbacks of using react:
1. still under development
2. harder to dubug because of the comolexity and the abstraction
